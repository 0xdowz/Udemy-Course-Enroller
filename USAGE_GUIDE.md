## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Filter Defaults
You can modify the default filters in `scheduler.py`:

```python
def _apply_default_filters(self, courses):
    filtered = filter_courses(
        courses,
        min_rating=4.0,        # Minimum rating

```python
# Change from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM
self.scheduler = start_scheduler(
    session=self.session,
    user_info=self.user_info,
    schedule_time="14:00"  # 24-hour format
)
```
